# kdeconnect-send.yazi

Send selected files to your smartphone or other devices using KDE Connect. This plugin allows you to quickly share files from Yazi file manager directly to any KDE Connect-paired device.

## Features

- Select and send multiple files to KDE Connect devices
- Automatically detects available and reachable KDE Connect devices
- Configurable device selection behavior with `auto_select_single` option
- Prompts for device selection when multiple devices are available
- Provides notifications for successful and failed transfers
- Warns when no files are selected

## Requirements

- KDE Connect installed on your system
- `kdeconnect-cli` command available in your PATH
- At least one device paired and reachable via KDE Connect

## Installation

### Using `ya pkg`

```sh
ya pkg add Deepak22903/kdeconnect-send
```

### Using Git

Clone the repository directly into your Yazi plugins directory:

```sh

```

## Usage

```

require("kdeconnect-send"):setup({
    auto_select_single = false,
})
```
